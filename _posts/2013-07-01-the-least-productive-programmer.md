This post serves as sort of an anti pattern for programming.

I've worked with lots of unproductive programmers over the years.  It's funny how often it comes up.  Whenever I mention one of them in conversion to non-programmers, usually over a drink of something strong, they're always suprised. 

This is because everyone else is used to working hard for money, and to advance their careers. 

You'd think these programmers would be paid badly.  Nope.  There is very little correleation between programming skill/productivity and salary.  Experience does matter, a good deal, but it's far from a sure thing.

There's almost always a story behind every unproductive programmer.  Usually the job comes with a sense of entitlement; you know the type.

I would generally argue that people are entitled to jobs to support their lives and family.  Well, by most people, I mean everyone except the *Unproductive Programmer*.  The problem with the UP is that engineering is hard, and takes a lot of time.  If you don't like it, it's a horrible career to half ass.
